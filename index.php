            Hello! Welcome to my website!<br><br>This is where you'll find a bunch of random stuff, including Stepmania simfiles I made, information about the site, contact info, pictures, and more! As you may be able to tell, the site is nowhere near finished and is pretty much just some fancy HTML and CSS put together, so feel free to send suggestions for the site!<br><br> In the Pictures section, you'll find... well... pictures! What you'll see depends on what I feel like putting up. Maybe it'll be screenshots of high scores, maybe projects, or maybe even the occasional embedded YouTube video.<br><br>Under the Contact tab is exactly what it sounds like. There, you'll find my email and some socal media links. But not a lot else, since there's not really much to put there to be honest.<br><br>Under the About section, you'll find some information about the site itself, and probably some more social media links.<br><br>Finally, in the Simfiles section, you'll find a few packs of simfiles I made for Stepmania. Actually, there's only one pack there right now, and it's not very good by any means, but it's playable. By clicking the pack banner, you'll find a song list and a list of difficulties, as well as installation instructions.
